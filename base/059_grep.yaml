    Grep is a command-line utility for searching plain-text data sets for lines that match a regular expression. Its name comes from the ed command g/re/p (global / regular expression search / and print), which has the same effect. Grep was originally developed for the Unix operating system, but later available for all Unix-like systems and some others such as OS-9.
